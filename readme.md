# üìù My Simple React To-Do List App

Hey there! üëã

This is a small but handy **To-Do List app** I built using React and TypeScript. It‚Äôs a fun little project that helps me keep track of tasks, and it saves everything right in your browser so you don‚Äôt lose your list ‚Äî even if you refresh the page or close the tab.

---

## What Can It Do?

* **Add new tasks** easily with a simple input box.
* **Mark tasks as done** just by clicking on them.
* **Delete tasks** when you no longer need them.
* **Automatically saves** everything in your browser so your list is always up to date.
* Looks nice with a smooth animated background and clean design.

## How Does It Work?

The app uses React hooks to manage the tasks and keeps everything stored in `localStorage`. That means no accounts, no servers ‚Äî just you and your list, ready whenever you want.
